            <p>
                Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) helps to elect a candidate who
                reflects a majority of voters in a single election even when
                several viable candidates are in the race. RCV is a way to
                ensure elections are fair for all voters. It allows voters the
                option to rank candidates in order of preference: one, two,
                three, and so forth.
            </p>

            <p>
                This calculator is for races where voters select one winner. If
                a candidate receives more than half of the first choices, that
                candidate wins, just like in any other election. However, if
                there is no majority winner after counting first choices, the
                race is decided by an "instant runoff." The candidate with the
                fewest votes is eliminated, and voters who picked that candidate
                as ‘number 1’ will have their votes count for their next choice.
                This process continues until there’s a majority winner or a
                candidate won with more than half of the vote.
