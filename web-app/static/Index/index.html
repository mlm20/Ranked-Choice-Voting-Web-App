                    Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) helps to elect a candidate who
                    reflects a majority of voters in a single election even when
                    several viable candidates are in the race. RCV is a way to
                    ensure elections are fair for all voters. It allows voters
                    the option to rank candidates in order of preference: one,
                    two, three, and so forth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This calculator is for races where voters select one winner.
                    If a candidate receives more than half of the first choices,
                    that candidate wins, just like in any other election.
                    However, if there is no majority winner after counting first
                    choices, the race is decided by an "instant runoff." The
                    candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and voters
                    who picked that candidate as ‘number 1’ will have their
                    votes count for their next choice. This process continues
                    until there’s a majority winner or a candidate won with more
                    than half of the vote.
